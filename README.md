# RFAGUI

## Code for RFA demo and parameter experimentation, with GUI.

The GUI contains:
1. 5-panel canvas with:
  - Waveform and AM envelope
  - FM envelope (F0 estimation, 'pitch' track)
  - LF spectrogram (heatmap format)
  - LF spectrogram (waterfall format)
  - LF spectram with entire recording as FFT window
2. Left hand panel with AM demodulation paramters.
3. Right hand panel with FM demodulation parameters for AMDF algorithm.
4. Bottom frame with input, message and default interaction

To be completed on publication of "Rhythm pattern discovery in Niger-Congo story-telling".

## Note: the main RFA implementation is in the RFA repository.
